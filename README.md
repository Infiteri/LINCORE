# CORE - Linux restarted version

This version serves as an introduction of the Core engine in the world of Linux (also for myself :))

# Libraries
    1. GLFW
    2. GLAD
    3. ImGui

# BUILD

Download the engine source code and go in the root directory
```
make Full
```
should build everything for LINUX

note that the Windows version should come soon with updates

# RUN

After building calling:
```
./Launch.sh
```
should open a 'konsole' window and the should start the editor
note that this requires 'konsole' package intalled. To install run 

```
sudo pacman -S konsole
```

(or whatever is your package manager)

For windows, just running the executable should be enough
